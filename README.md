# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is my first Tic-Tac-Toe project written in C.  
It is a simple two-player game that displays the board after every move and automatically checks for a win or draw.

## How to Run
1. Open terminal or command prompt  
2. Navigate to the project folder  
3. Compile the program: `gcc main.c -o tictactoe`  
4. Run the program: `./tictactoe`
